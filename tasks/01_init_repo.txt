  Generate a self-executing bash script that performs the following exact steps. Do not output any markdown formatting around the bash script, output ONLY the valid bash script.
  
  1. Create a directory named `SmartChrome` and `cd` into it.
  2. Initialize a Git repository.
  3. Create a `.gitignore` that ignores `*.pyc`, `__pycache__/`, `venv/`, and `logs/`.
  4. Create a `docs/` folder and create an empty `architecture_state.xml` inside it.
  5. Create a `tasks/` folder. This will hold the XML task definitions.
  6. Create a `scripts/` folder.
  7. Create a `README.md` explaining that this repo is a "Prompt Task Queue for Gemini CLI" and does not contain Chromium source code.
  8. Commit the initial structure with message "chore: initialize SmartChrome prompt task queue".
