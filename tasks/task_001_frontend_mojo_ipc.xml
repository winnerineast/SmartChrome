  <prompt_payload>
    <context>
      Read the architecture state document (docs/architecture_state.xml). We are beginning the implementation of MOD_01_FRONTEND_ENGINE and IPC_PROTOCOL.
      Our goal is to create a new isolated utility process in Chromium that will host our VLM (Model A). 
      This initial task requires defining the core Mojo IPC interfaces that will bridge the Browser process (where UI events and rendering happen) with our new isolated VLM process.
    </context>

    <requirements>
      1. Create a new Mojo interface definition file for the VLM agent.
      2. The interface should be named `VLMObserver`.
      3. It must include a method `OnPageStateCaptured` that accepts:
         - A shared memory buffer or BigBuffer for the viewport screenshot (RGBA data).
         - A string representing the simplified A11y Tree (bounding boxes).
      4. It must return a string `action_response` (JSON representing the VLM's decision, e.g., click/scroll).
      5. Include a method `ReportHumanCorrection` (taking state_id, bad_action, good_action as strings) for our Pillar 2 Intercept mechanism.
    </requirements>

    <execution_directive>
      We are creating a completely NEW file. Output the EXACT file path relative to Chromium's `src` root where this should reside (e.g., `components/vlm_agent/public/mojom/vlm_agent.mojom`).
      Then, output the full file content inside a standard creation block. Do NOT wrap it in markdown block quotes. Use the following format strictly:

      ++++ components/vlm_agent/public/mojom/vlm_agent.mojom
      module vlm_agent.mojom;
      
      import "mojo/public/mojom/base/big_buffer.mojom";
      // ... rest of your code ...
      ++++
